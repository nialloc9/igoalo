PHP stands for hyper text pre-processer. Originally it stood for personnal home page. PHP is a server side 
scripting language. This code is not available for the user to see. Unlike HTML which is a mark-up language
for the browser. It is used to create dynamic websites. It is essentially creating a programme in a website.
We can combine PHP with a database to take and store information. Facebook uses PHP You can go on the PHP 
website and search function names and get information and examples on how to use them.

isset means if the element is selected. e.g button clicked.

$_POST is telling it to take the information from the text box or whatever.

This works like this isset($_POST['name of text box']);
